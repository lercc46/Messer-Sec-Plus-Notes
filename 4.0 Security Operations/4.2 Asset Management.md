Full objective: "Explain the security implications of proper hardware, software,
and data asset management."

### Asset Management
- Acquisition/procurement process - the purchasing process
	- Start with request from user
	- Negotiate with suppliers
	- Purchase, invoice, and payment
- Assignment/accounting
	- Central asset tracking system to keep tabs
	- Ownership - associate person with asset
	- Classification - type of asset
		- Then classify it as hardware or software (taxed differently)
		- Hardware = capital expenditure
		- Software = operating expenditure
- Monitoring / asset tracking
	- Inventory every asset
	- Ability to associate support ticket with device make and model
	- Enumeration - list all parts of an asset, list as entity
	- Add an asset tag - barcode, RFID, tracking number, org. name, etc.
- Media sanitization
	- System disposal or decommissioning - completely remove data for security
	- Different use cases - clean hard drive, permanently delete single file, etc.
	- One-way trip so no recovery with forensics tools
	- Reuse the storage media
- Physical destruction - no recovery, no reuse, absolute certainty of destruction
	- Shredder/pulverizer - complete destruction
	- Drill/hammer - quick and easy
	- Electromagnetic (degaussing)
	- Incineration - fire :)
- Certificate of destruction - what if you need to destroy in bulk
	- Often done by 3rd party, need confirmation for destruction
	- Thus, service involves certificate with paper trail of destruction
- Data retention - back up your data!
	- Regulatory compliance - certain amount of data backup to comply
	- Operational needs - accidental deletion, disaster recovery
	- Differentiate by type and application
