Full objective: "Explain the importance of resilience and recovery in security
architecture."

### Resiliency
- High availability
	- Redundant doesn't always mean available
	- HA (high-availability): always on, always available
		- Expensive (more systems, upgraded power, etc.)
- Server clustering: combine two or more servers to function as one
	- Usually configured in the OS
	- ![[server-cluster.png]]
- Load balancing: load distributed across multiple servers using load balancer
	- Distribute from central point
	- Adds or removes devices as needed
- Site resiliency
	- Recovery site is prepped
	- Disaster called, recover site used, problem addressed, back to primary
	- Hot site: exact replica of data center
		- Update data, software, AND hardware
	- Cold site: no hardware, empty building
		- Bring your own data and people
	- Warm site: just enough to get going
		- Big room with rack space, still bring your own stuff
	- Geographic dispersion
		- Recovery sites should be far enough away to not be affected by similar physical events (eg., natural disaster)
- Platform diversity: use different platforms/apps for different purposes
	- Spread the risk - if one vulnerability affects Windows, everything shouldn't shut down because of it 
- Multi-cloud systems
	- Plan for cloud outages
	- Disperse data between multiple geographical sites and multiple cloud providers
- Continuity of operations planning (COOP)
	- Have an alternative to all technological systems in case of disaster
	- Document and test BEFORE a problem occurs
### Capacity Planning
- Match supply to demand
- People - some services require human intervention
	- Not easy to add and remove
- Technology - pick tech that can scale
	- Web services - distribute load across multiple
	- Database services - cluster multiple SQL servers
	- Cloud services - (seemingly) unlimited resources (if you pay)
- Infrastructure: the underlying framework
	- Physical devices - purchase, configure, install
	- Cloud-based - easier to deploy and useful for unexpected changes
### Recovery Testing
- Test before an actual event
	- Use well-defined rules of engagement, a very specific scenario, and evaluate response
- Tabletop exercises: faux logistics for analysis
	- No physical drill or recovery, talk through a simulated disaster
- Fail over test
	- Ensure redundant systems switch to backups when a failure occurs
	- ![[fail-over.png]]
- Simulation: test with a fully simulated event
	- Common - phishing simulation (curated emails, etc.)
- Parallel processing: split a process through multiple parallel CPUs
	- Improved performance and recovery
### Backups
- Incredibly important for resilience and recovery
- Implementations:
	- Total data, type, media, storage location, software, time
- Onsite vs. offsite
	- Onsite: not internet link, data immediately available, less expensive
	- Offsite: transfer over internet or WAN link, available after disaster, performed from anywhere
	- Organizations often use both for more options
- Frequency: how often?
	- May be different between systems
	- May be multiple backup sets
- Encryption
	- Backups contain a history of data, makes it easy for an attacker
	- Protect using encryption = unreadable, recovery key required to restore
	- Useful for cloud backups and storage
- Snapshots: instant backup of entire system
	- Popular on virtual machines
	- Take snapshot after 24 hours, contains only changes between snapshots
	- ![[snapshots.png]]
- Recovery testing: simulate disaster, attempt to restore from backup
	- Simulate, restore, test restorations
- Replication: keep data synchronized in multiple locations
	- Ongoing, (almost) real-time backup
	- Always available, stored locally, recoverable
- Journaling: like a data buffer
	- When writing, if power goes out, data may be corrupted or only a portion of the data may be saved
	- By writing to the journal, you essentially have two copies of the data being stored while it is being written
	- Data transfer redundancy!! :)
### Power Resiliency
- Power is the foundation of our technology
- We usually don't make our own power - ways to mitigate issues
- UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply): short-term backup power
	- Blackouts, brownouts (partial blackout), power surges
	- Types:
		- Offline/standby
		- Line-interactive
		- On-line/double-conversion
	- Features
		- Auto-shutdown, battery capacity, outlets, phone line suppression, etc.
- Generators: long-term power backup, fuel storage required
	- Power an entire building, may take a few minutes to get up to speed
