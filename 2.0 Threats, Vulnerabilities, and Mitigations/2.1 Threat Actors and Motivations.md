Full objective: "Compare and contrast common threat actors and motivations."

### Threat Actors
- The entity responsible for an event that has an impact on the safety of another entity
	- Also called a malicious actor
	- Attributes (types, etc.) of threat actors often considered
- Useful to categorize motivation -- why is this attack happening?
- Attributes of threat actors
	- Internal vs. external (within or outside a company)
	- Resources and funding (no money vs. extensive funding)
	- Level of sophistication (script kiddie or nation-state zero-days)
- Motivations of threat actors
	- Data exfiltration
	- Espionage
	- Service disruption
	- Blackmail
	- Financial gain
	- Philosophical/political
	- Ethical
	- Revenge
	- Disruption/chaos
	- War
- Nation states
	- External entity
	- Motivations could be data exfiltration, political, revenge, disruption, war
	- Constant attacks, massive resources
		- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
	- Highest sophistication
		- Military control, utilities, finances
		- Stuxnet (U.S. and Israel) destroyed 1,000 nuclear centrifuges
- Unskilled attackers
	- Runs pre-made scripts
	- Motivated by the hunt (disruption, data exfiltration, financial)
	- Can be internal or external
	- Not very sophisticated
	- No formal funding (low hanging fruit)
- Hacktivist
	- Hacker with a purpose (philosophy, politics, ethics, disruption)
	- Often external (could infiltrate to be internal)
	- Can be remarkably sophisticated (DDoS, defacing websites, releasing documents)
	- Funding may be limited, some perform fundraising
- Insider threat

- Organized crime
	- Professional criminals (almost always money)
	- Very sophisticated, hierarchical
	- Lots of capital, the best tools and personnel money can buy
- Shadow IT
	- Going rogue inside their own internal IT,
	- IT can put up roadblocks, so those in IT are a more advanced internal threat
	- Limit resources with company budget
	- Medium sophistication, some have IT background
